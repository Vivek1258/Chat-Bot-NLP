# Chat-Bot-NLP


# Chat Bot :

A chatbot also known as a chatterbot, bot, artificial agent, etc . 
It is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human.

In this project we are going to Build a chat Bot Using nltk. NLP-Python is the key to the idea behind the chat bot.

This chat-bot is more informative than interactive.The main aim is to provide proper information about the topic in a formal way (We can use many ways to discribe the personality ) . Here Mr. DB can answer any question about CANCER.

The Basic Idea behind the caht-Bot is :
Input -->  Understanding / Extracting the meaning of the sentence (NLU : Tokenization ,Lemmatization , Noemalization , Removing stopwords , Recognising Entetis , Dependancy Parsing, etc )  --> Generation of the proper / most relavent answer from the data (NLG )  here we are finding the most relatable answer to the question (Bag of words / TF-IDF vectoraization approch -- Cosine similarity )

PS : This project is to anderstand the exact meaning behind the word maping and all the relations hence we have used all the simpler tecquenics 

One can go for Different approches for Ex :
1 ) Using generic framework :: NLTK has a module, nltk.chat, which simplifies building these engines by providing a generic framework.

2) Using deep learning techniques :: The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories, pattern and responses.One can use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then , will give a random response from the list of responses.

3) ChatterBot  :: It is a library in python which generates responses to user input. It uses a number of machine learning algorithms to produce a variety of responses.

4) We can even go for many responce models(Ex. Alicebot , Evibot, etc ) at a time and use a proper model selection polocy (lets say using Crowdsourcing + Reinforcement Learning ) 
etc


The O/P of the chat is :
